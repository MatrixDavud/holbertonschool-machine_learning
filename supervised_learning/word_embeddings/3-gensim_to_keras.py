"""
Module that converts a gensim Word2Vec model to a Keras Embedding layer.

This module provides the function gensim_to_keras
which extracts the weight matrix from a
trained gensim Word2Vec model and creates a Keras Embedding
layer initialized with these weights.
The embedding layer is trainable.

    Converts a gensim Word2Vec model to a Keras Embedding layer.

    The function extracts the word vectors from t
